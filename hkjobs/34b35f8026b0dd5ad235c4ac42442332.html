In this role, you&rsquo;ll carefully consider the context of our decisions as we think about the tradeoffs we&rsquo;re making in our approach to resolving cybersecurity issues. We&rsquo;ll expect you to apply a methodical approach to performing unstructured investigations to locate and repair the source of a security issue.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   You will also act as an ambassador of best practices to the rest of the firm.  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   Team members understand and practice good personal cybersecurity hygiene, and are able to talk to others about it. A key component of doing well in this position is bringing everyone else along with you on the cybersecurity journey, and you should be excited to learn from your colleagues and pass that learning on to new Analysts.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   Strong scripting is a minimum, programming a plus.  </span> </p> <h3>  About You </h3> <ul>  <li>   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    B.S. in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Systems, or equivalent experience preferred   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    An avid follower of cybersecurity news&nbsp;   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    A strong scripter; you should be able to write scripts that are clear, general, and could be integrated into existing tooling using a fully-featured programming language&nbsp;   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Comfortable and interested in managing your code and configs in version control, and knowledgeable about your editor (we don't care which though)   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Familiar with threat modeling, and able to clearly communicate your understanding of the tradeoffs we&rsquo;re making to internal stakeholders   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Able to explain the cybersecurity decisions you&rsquo;ve made in your own life, and how you&rsquo;ve approached thinking about those decisions&nbsp;   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Able to adapt to changing scenarios and make challenging decisions under pressure   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Humble attitude about what you know and don&rsquo;t know; not afraid to ask questions and admit mistakes   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Curious problem solver with a positive, collaborative attitude   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Programming experience is a plus   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Fluency in English required   </span>  </li> </ul></div></p>
