<div class="col-12"> <h3>  About the Position </h3> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   We are looking for a Paralegal to join our brand new Legal Operations team. In this role, you&rsquo;ll work alongside seasoned colleagues, learning to manage the many moving pieces that keep our systems and processes running smoothly. You&rsquo;ll also handle daily tasks and ad hoc projects across a wide range of legal and compliance work.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   The Legal Operations team is responsible for many of the support, administrative, and process functions of the broader Legal &amp; Compliance group. As an early member of this fledgling team, you&rsquo;ll interact with wide swaths of the firm, including our tech departments and trading desks, and help to manage workflows. You&rsquo;ll be an important face of Legal Operations, often serving as the first exposure of our other business units to Legal &amp; Compliance&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll think about how to better connect Legal &amp; Compliance to the broader firm. You&rsquo;ll also interact with key external parties, including exchanges, regulators, and government agencies.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   The regulatory landscape within our industry is complex and evolving. You&rsquo;ll be an integral part of our team as we coordinate regulatory filings and assist in establishing new legal entities. You&rsquo;ll also be responsible for filing contracts, managing multiple databases, exchange applications, and for coordinating internal policy and procedure reviews. We&rsquo;ll count on you to keep a constant eye on our processes, documenting them and continuously searching for ways we can improve and become more efficient.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   The right person for this role will enjoy working with both paperwork and people, and be able to answer questions and explain processes clearly to a wide range of colleagues. You should be excited about digging into the weeds to understand how things work, and how to make them work better. We don&rsquo;t expect you to have a background in compliance&mdash;teaching and learning from our colleagues is an all-important part of our business. And as you learn the ins and outs of a financial firm, this role will offer ample opportunity for growth within the company, and the chance to take ownership of some of our critical processes.  </span> </p> <h3>  About You </h3> <ul>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Bachelor&rsquo;s degree required   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    2+ years of experience in a corporate environment; some exposure to compliance is a plus   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Motivated self-starter who can handle competing priorities and work effectively in a challenging, fast-paced environment   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Excellent attention to detail and organizational skills   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Communicates clearly with colleagues and external partners   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   Fluency in English required,   <span>    fluency in Mandarin preferred   </span>  </li> </ul></div>
