<div class="col-12"> <h3>  About the Position </h3> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   We are looking for a FIX Onboarding and Connectivity Engineer to help us design and deploy our in-house order engines to allow our trading desks to trade new products and exchanges.   <br/>   <br/>  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   This role will involve a mix of technical project work and learning our systems and infrastructure through a support rotation. Jane Street is a place where people come to learn new things (and to eventually teach others what they know), so while experience with FIX and other order flow/electronic trading protocols and onboarding is a plus, it is certainly not required.   <br/>   <br/>  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   The majority of your time on the Order Engines Team will focus on onboarding and connectivity projects. This will involve prioritizing requests from the trading desks; liaising and working with our developers, engineers, and external parties; and seeing the onboarding process all the way through to production. We work in a technical environment, so you will need to write code of varying levels of complexity to get these projects completed.   <br/>   <br/>  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   Roughly a quarter of your time will be spent on a rotation where you'll monitor the health of Jane Street&rsquo;s order engines and related systems, handling connectivity issues with brokers and trading venues. This will involve liaising with trading desks and application developers to keep our trading running smoothly.&nbsp;   <br/>   <br/>  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   As you do this work, we will expect you to keep a thoughtful and empathetic perspective on the way the team functions and collaborates as a whole, and to come up with ideas for how we can develop, improve, and promote our best practices. We'll also look to you for opinions on how we approach and deliver project work, and how we should interface with other internal teams.  </span> </p> <h3>  About You </h3> <ul>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Enjoys learning the micro structure of different exchanges   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Comfortable operating in a Unix environment   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Experience with writing code and/or scripting   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Excellent coordinating and project management skills   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Has a sense of responsibility; able to perform and prioritize under pressure   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Detail-oriented with strong communication skills   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Can debug and troubleshoot technically complex systems   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Fluent in English   </span>  </li> </ul></div>
