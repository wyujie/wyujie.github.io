<p>Our global Markets teams are active in all major financial markets and develop sophisticated financial solutions to help clients manage risk, increase returns and solve complex financial problems. Globally, we hold leadership positions across all major financial markets. This approach means you'll be part of a dynamic team, helping to solve a range of challenging and interesting business issues and will be challenged in your work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Trading at J.P. Morgan is a unique insight into global markets – we provide liquidity to clients in all major asset classes and pride ourselves on our fast execution, market share and e-trading platforms. A trader’s role is to respond to and encourage client enquiries, manage the resulting risk, and respond to market-moving events. Trading is detail-focused, intellectually stimulating and requires logical and quick decision-making.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Throughout the internship, you’ll support senior colleagues with important research, analysis and preparatory work. You will monitor markets, develop trade ideas, conduct portfolio reviews, and learn about the solutions and products we offer for clients to manage any market conditions. Your work and contributions will be valuable to the team from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Expert instructors and J.P. Morgan professionals will teach you about our history, the scale and scope of our organization today and our ambitious plans for tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This program is an opportunity to take your career to the next level through hands-on experience, relevant skills training and valuable professional networking. As it is a pipeline for future graduate opportunities, based on individual performance and achievements, those who successfully complete the program may receive offers of full-time employment with the firm in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
