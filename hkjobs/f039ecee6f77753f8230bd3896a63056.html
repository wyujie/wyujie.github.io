Members of this group are hard-working Systems Engineers, Administrators and Programmers, tasked with maintaining and improving the platform that powers Jane Street's production trading systems.

We work directly with colleagues in Trading, Technology, and Operations to build and maintain systems with a firm-wide scope.
