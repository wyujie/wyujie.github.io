There's no specific checklist; we use software to approach a variety of problems, so we're interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design  </li>  <li>   Strong interpersonal skills. Software engineering at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams  </li>  <li>   Fluency in English required  </li> </ul> <p>  We don&rsquo;t expect you to have experience with functional programming, OCaml, or finance; we&rsquo;re happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.&nbsp; </p> <p>  If you'd like to get an idea of what we cover in our software engineering interview process, you can read our series of  discussing what we do and don't look for. </p></div>
