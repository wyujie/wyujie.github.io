<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /><div class="col-12"> <h3>  About the Position </h3> <p>  Our trading is based on our own proprietary models and on busy days we engage in over a million trades. Traders work in teams to seek out and trade on pricing inefficiencies, develop models, manage risk, investigate new products, and push into new business areas. Experienced Traders teach and oversee the less-experienced. New Traders serve as assistants while they learn the ropes, getting increasing responsibility as they demonstrate their ability to handle it. </p> <p>  Technology is at the core of how we approach trading, and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm. We use OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language, and have the largest team of OCaml Engineers in any industrial setting. </p> <h3>  About You </h3> <p>  We are looking for people who have a strong quantitative mind and enjoy working collaboratively to solve challenging problems in a practical setting. Prior knowledge of finance or economics is not expected or required. Experience with particular programming languages is also not required, although generally being comfortable programming in your language of choice is a plus. Fluency in English required. </p></div>
