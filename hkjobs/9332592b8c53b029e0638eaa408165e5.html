        <p><div class="col-12"> <h3>  About the Position </h3> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   We are looking for a Trading Desk Operations Specialist to help us manage the operational side of the trading desk. We&rsquo;ll rely on you to monitor trading tools, manage and update complex spreadsheets, optimize our existing processes, and develop new tools for the desk. Our  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   are integral to the firm&rsquo;s success,  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   building and maintaining desk infrastructure that is responsible for trading thousands of financial products  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   across 200 trading venues around the world.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   In this role, you&rsquo;ll interact with various internal groups and external parties. As you work alongside more experienced team members, you&rsquo;ll learn the flow of the trading and settlement cycle, and the regulatory and operational considerations of each step. Over time, as you become more familiar with the day-to-day operations of the desk, you&rsquo;ll dedicate increasing amounts of time to programming, assisting Traders more directly, or building out the firm's infrastructure. Eventually, you'll be able to leverage your experience to cover a wider range of work, handling both immediate time-sensitive tasks and thinking about longer term strategic project work.  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   Our trading desks are central to our collaborative and cooperative office environment, and we believe the best way to integrate new hires is through a hands-on, interactive approach. From the beginning, you can expect to work side by side with more experienced TDO Specialists who are committed to teaching, guiding, and supporting our newest hires. Along the way, we'll continue to support your development through mentorship and training programs designed to set you up for success.&nbsp;  </span> </p> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   If you&rsquo;d like to learn more, you can read about our  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   and meet some of our  </span>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   .  </span> </p> <h3>  About You </h3> <p>  <span style="font-weight: 400;">   We&rsquo;re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We&rsquo;re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:  </span> </p> <ul>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    A critical thinker with a strong quantitative foundation and an interest in expanding your technical skills   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    An agile and adaptive problem solver   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Able to balance competing priorities in a fast-paced environment   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Proactive, reliable, and courteous with strong organizational and communication skills   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Eager to ask questions, admit mistakes, learn new things, and continuously improve   </span>  </li>  <li style="font-weight: 400;">   <span style="font-weight: 400;">    Fluent in English   </span>  </li> </ul></div></p>
