<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />The Fixed Income Federal Risk Applications department has a strong presence in Hong Kong.  Our focus is developing systems serving as a data integration and feeding platform, ensuring that calculation results and other data initiated in our Division reaches our downstream clients and meeting all their requirements. The main challenges in this area are the volume of the data (feeding hundreds of gigabytes daily), interfacing with multiple other systems, being exposed to different financial products to a certain extent and being resilient to errors while keeping our SLA-s. The data we feed is critical in fulfilling the regulatory requirements set by the FED, PRA or BAFIN. Our team is also involved in developing calculations of regulatory scenarios requested by our Market Risk Department. The main technical challenge for this team is computational complexity.<br><br>We offer:<br>-	Work for the firm that attracts some of the brightest talents like Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of the C++ language <br>-	A supportive and vibrant multinational environment, which is leveraging technology to its highest potential.
